**IMPORTANT**
- [ ] Add global feature to fannet
- [ ] consistent the direction of mesh norm
- [ ] consistent the start vertex of path
- [ ] Sort and expand edgev_idx cost too much memory. Optimize it make use of more than half neg idx
- [ ] Augdata: randomly change norm direction

**RECONSIDER**
- [ ] Pre down sampling, leads to lost of too many edges. Need to add new edges.
- [ ] Refine lonely vertex treatment
